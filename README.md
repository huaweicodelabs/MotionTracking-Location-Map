## Introduction
    Motion tracking codelab sample code encapsulates APIs of the HUAWEI Location Kit and Map Kit.
    In this codelab, we will take a closer look into how this is made possible, with user running used as an example, for the motion tracking capabilities in Location Kit and Map Kit, which you can integrate into your app with ease.
    · Use Location Kit to obtain the user's current location and real-time location updates.
    · Use Location Kit to obtain the user's current location and real-time location updates.
    · Use the mock location function in Location Kit to reproduce the motion track.


## Installation
   1. Check whether the Android studio(3.x+) development environment is ready, and your device or virtual device which have installed latest Huawei Mobile Service(HMS Core) Apk.
   2. Register a [HUAWEI account](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/).
   3. Open the Location Kit, Map Kit from [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/service/josp/agc/index.html).
   4. Download and build this demo.
   5. Configure the sample code:
        (1) Download the file "agconnect-services.json" of the app on AppGallery Connect, and add the file to the app root directory(\app) of the demo.
        (2) Change the value of applicationId and signingConfigs in the app-level build.gradle file of the sample project to the package name of your app.
   6. Run the sample on your Android device.

    
## Supported Environments
	Android Studio
	Java


##  Result
    This demo provides demonstration for following scenarios:
    1. Create an app in AppGallery Connect.
    2. Enable Location Kit and Map Kit.
    3. Integrate Location Kit to obtain real-time location information, and use the mock location function.
    4. Integrate Map Kit to display maps, as well as draw motion tracks and icons on maps.
